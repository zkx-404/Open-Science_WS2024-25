This repository serves the research project in the Open Science module in the winter semester 2024-25. Scripts and sample data sets created by us are uploaded here.
A Visuan Language Model from Microsoft is used to conduct the experiment. https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct 
The data set used is “government_reports_test_captioning” from Hugging Face. https://huggingface.co/datasets/vidore/syntheticDocQA_government_reports_test_captioning 

The underlying study we are trying to replicate is this one.    Medhi, D. (2024). Target Prompting for Information Extraction with Vision Language Model (arXiv:2408.03834). arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2408.03834
